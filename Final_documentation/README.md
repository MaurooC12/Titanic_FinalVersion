# Final Project Deliverables & Documentation

**Titanic**
*Machine Learning from disaster*

---

## Overview
This folder contains the **final artifacts** of the Systems Analysis project.
Instead of a traditional data science approach, these documents evidence the engineering process of treating the Titanic dataset as a **Closed System**, analyzing its structural instability, and designing a robust **ISO-25010 Architecture** to stabilize it.

## Artifacts Description

| File | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Paper.pdf`** | **Scientific Summary** | A concise academic paper (IEEE format) summarizing the research problem, the proposed **Reliability Layer**, and the validation results through ML and Cellular Automata simulations. |
| **`Technical_report.pdf`** | **Deep Dive (Full Documentation)** | The complete engineering compendium (Workshops 1-4). Includes detailed **System Analysis**, **Requirements Engineering**, **Architecture Design**, and full code implementation details. |
| **`Slides.pdf`** | **Presentation Deck** | The visual narrative used for the defense. Covers the journey from **Historical Chaos** to **Engineering Order**, highlighting the *Sensitivity Analysis* and *Emergent Behavior* visualizations. |
| **`Poster.pdf`** | **Visual Abstract** | A high-impact visual summary designed for quick consumption. Showcases the **Closed-Loop Architecture** and the key findings of the simulation engines side-by-side. |
